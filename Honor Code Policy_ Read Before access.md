Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. 
If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. 
Students must keep appropriate records at all times. 
The inability to authenticate oneâ€™s work, should the instructor request it, is sufficient grounds to initiate an academic dishonesty case.
